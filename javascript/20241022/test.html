                Great question! The distinction between const and how it works with primitive values versus reference types (like arrays) is an important aspect of JavaScript. Let's break it down.

            1. const and Primitive Values
            When you declare a variable with const, it means that the variable's reference cannot be changed. However, if the variable holds a primitive value (like a number, string, boolean, etc.), you cannot change that value:

            javascript

            複製
            const a = 1;
            a = 2; // This will throw an error: "Assignment to constant variable."
            In this case, a is assigned a primitive value of 1, and trying to reassign it results in an error.

            2. const and Reference Types
            When you declare a variable with const that holds a reference type (like an array or an object), you cannot change the reference itself (i.e., you cannot assign a new array or object to that variable). However, you can modify the contents of the object or array that it points to:

            javascript

            複製
            const b = [1, 2, 3];
            b[0] = 10; // This is allowed
            console.log(b); // Output: [10, 2, 3]

            b = [4, 5, 6]; // This will throw an error: "Assignment to constant variable."
            Explanation
            Immutability of Reference:
            When you declare const a = 1;, a refers to the primitive value 1. Since primitives are immutable, you cannot change the value of a.
            When you declare const b = [1, 2, 3];, b refers to the array [1, 2, 3]. While you cannot change b to point to a new array, you can modify the contents of the existing array.
            Reference vs. Value:
            Primitives are stored directly in the variable, while reference types store a reference (or pointer) to the memory location where the data is stored.
            With reference types, the data itself can be changed without changing the reference.
            Summary
            For primitives: const prevents reassignment of the variable.
            For reference types: const prevents reassignment of the reference, but you can still change the properties or elements of the referenced object or array.
            This behavior is fundamental to understanding how JavaScript handles different data types. If you have more questions or need further clarifications, feel free to ask!
